# What is a Binary Crown? 

Ok, as you may have already guessed, a “binary crown” isn’t really a thing! 
My cover photo features participants’ handiwork at  binary crown making event, which I organized as SWiCS* Webmaster.  The event was open to all students 
 foam 1s and 0s ** [
My goal was for the event to be just a fun break from studying & computers and a low-key context to interact with computer science students.
Late one evening, near the end of the semester, two other board members and I, along with most of the rest of the class. were in the computer science lab.
